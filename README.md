# automate-dotnetcore
This is a collection of simple programs, using C#, for automating everyday tasks with .NET Core.
So far I've made available examples on how to:
- Organize files inside a folder according to date: date-named-folders
- Compress files inside a given folder into a ZIP archive: compress-folder-zip


The samples are built with [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), the integrated terminal and the following extensions:
- [C#](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp)
- [Nuget Package Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jmrog.vscode-nuget-package-manager)
